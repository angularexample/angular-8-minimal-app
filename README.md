# angular-8-minimal-app

Angular 8 Minimal App. This app has the bare minimum of files and configuration for an Angular 8 app.

You can download and use this app to start a simple Angular project.

It is perfect if you just want to experiment with some Angular coding, or if you are creating a project to demonstrate just one thing.

If you are starting a regular project, then use one of the other seed apps that you can find in this github.

## Purpose Of This Project

The purpose of this project is to provide the smallest and simplest app for Angular 8.

### Ng New Does Work For Angular 8

If you have tried using ```ng new``` or ```ng new ---minimal```
you will find that you get **Angular 7**.

They both also give you more stuff than you need like Angular Forms or Angular Routing.

So I created this app for anyone who wants the minimal app for Angular 8.

It can be used to create a sandbox for experimenting with Angular code, or to write a demo that shows just one thing.

You can add whatever else you want.

## Project Setup

### Prerequisites

You need to have Node and NPM installed on your PC.

[Downloading and installing Node.js and npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

### How To Install

Download the source code using git or else download and unzip the zip file.

Open a terminal window and go to the project root folder.

You need to have npm installed globally.

Run `npm i` to install the required libraries.

### How To Run

Run `ng serve` for a dev server.

Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.

The browser will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Software Libraries Used

The following software libraries are used:
```text
Angular 8.2.2
```

## What Is Not Included

All library packages that are not required to build and run a basic Angular app are not included.

Not Included:

* Testing with Jasmine and Karma
* Angular libraries like Routing and Forms

All of the extra stuff that you get by using ```ng new``` has been removed.
